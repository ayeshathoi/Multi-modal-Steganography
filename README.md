## Multi-modal Steganography 
Steganography is the art of hiding secret data within an ordinary, non-secret, file or message in order to avoid detection. There are many different techniques for steganography, but the most common technique is to hide data within an image, audio, video, or text file. 
This project implements multi-modal steganography, which is a technique of hiding data in multiple types of files. The data is hidden in such a way that it is not visible or audible to the human eye or ear. The data is hidden in the files by modifying the least significant bits of the pixels, audio samples, or text characters.

### Image Steganography 
- Image Steganography is a technique of hiding data in images.
- The data is hidden in such a way that it is not visible to the naked eye.
- Lossless image formats like PNG, BMP, and TIFF are used for image steganography.
- The data is hidden in the image by modifying the least significant bits of the image pixels.

### Audio Steganography
- Audio Steganography is a technique of hiding data in audio files.
- The data is hidden in such a way that it is not audible to the human ear.
- Lossless audio formats like WAV, FLAC, and AIFF are used for audio steganography.
